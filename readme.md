# Beerfactory

Beerfactory is a complete software/hardware solution for homebrewers. May features are :
 - controlling a home-made brewery and the whole brewing process.
 - recipe design and simulation.
 - business activity management from purchase to sales, stocks management, production planning or customer relationship management.

Beerfactory is developed mostly in [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/). The architecture is based on :
 - a server side using [Play](https://www.playframework.com/) framework
 - a client side which uses [Scala.js](http://www.scala-js.org/) to compile scala code into javascript.

Both [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [H2](http://h2database.com/html/main.html) can be used for storage.

Server and client side can be embedded (with H2) to provide a all-in-one software easily installable.
